## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language**: Go 1.22+
- **Database**: SQLite with GORM
- **Configuration**: Viper
- **Logging**: Zerolog
- **UI Framework**: Wails v2 (upcoming in Phase 3)
- **Audio Libraries**: go-mp3, flac, beep (upcoming in Phase 2)

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows Clean Architecture principles with:
- **Domain Layer**: Core business entities and rules
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and business logic
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database, external services
- **Presentation Layer**: UI and API endpoints

Key patterns implemented:
- Repository Pattern for data access
- Dependency Injection
- Configuration management
- Structured logging
- Database migrations

## 📝 Configuration

Configuration is managed through YAML files with the following hierarchy:
1. Default settings (embedded)
2. System-wide settings (`%ProgramData%\WinRamp\config.yaml`)
3. User settings (`%AppData%\WinRamp\config.yaml`)
4. Command-line flags

Example configuration:
```yaml
app:
  name: WinRamp
  theme: dark
  
audio:
  output_device: default
  buffer_size: 2048
  
library:
  watch_folders:
    - C:\Music
  auto_scan: true
```
