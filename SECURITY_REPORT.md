# WinRamp Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary
A comprehensive security audit was performed on the WinRamp application, identifying and remediating 6 critical to medium severity vulnerabilities. All identified issues have been successfully addressed through code modifications and security enhancements.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. CRITICAL: Path Traversal in Album Art Storage
**Location**: `internal/library/scanner.go:339-380`

**Issue**: The album art extraction function was vulnerable to path traversal attacks, potentially allowing malicious media files to write arbitrary files outside the cache directory.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added comprehensive path validation using `filepath.Clean()` and `filepath.Rel()`
- Implemented checks for directory traversal patterns (`..`, absolute paths)
- Added logging for potential traversal attempts
- Ensured all file operations remain within the designated cache directory

**Code Changes**:
```go
// Verify the final path is within our cache directory
relPath, err := filepath.Rel(cacheDir, cleanedPath)
if err != nil || strings.HasPrefix(relPath, "..") || filepath.IsAbs(relPath) {
    logger.Warn("Invalid path detected: potential traversal attempt")
    return ""
}
```

### 2. CRITICAL: SQL Query Construction Vulnerability
**Location**: `internal/infrastructure/db/track_repository.go:132-180`

**Issue**: The search functionality was potentially vulnerable to SQL injection through insufficient input sanitization.

**Fix Applied**:
- Implemented comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Added query length limits to prevent DoS attacks
- Created `sanitizeSearchQuery()` function to remove dangerous SQL patterns
- Maintained parameterized queries through GORM for defense in depth

**Code Changes**:
- Removed SQL comment markers (`--`, `/*`, `*/`)
- Stripped semicolons and backslashes
- Eliminated null bytes and control characters
- Limited query length to 100 characters

### 3. HIGH: Frontend Input Validation Missing
**Location**: `frontend/src/`

**Issue**: The frontend lacked comprehensive input validation and XSS prevention mechanisms.

**Fix Applied**:
- Created new `security.js` module with comprehensive validation utilities
- Implemented secure DOM manipulation functions
- Added XSS prevention through HTML escaping
- Created `main-secure.js` using safe DOM building methods
- Implemented Content Security Policy recommendations

**New Security Features**:
- `escapeHtml()` - Prevents XSS attacks
- `sanitizeSearchInput()` - Validates search queries
- `isValidFilePath()` - Prevents path traversal
- `sanitizePlaylistName()` - Sanitizes user input
- `createElement()` - Safe DOM element creation
- `sanitizeUrl()` - URL validation

### 4. HIGH: Insecure Configuration File Permissions
**Location**: `internal/config/config.go:315-329`

**Issue**: Configuration files were created with overly permissive file permissions (0755), potentially exposing sensitive data.

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed directory permissions from 0755 to 0700 (owner-only access)
- Set configuration file permissions to 0600 (owner read/write only)
- Implemented configuration encryption for sensitive values
- Created `encryption.go` module for secure storage

**New Features**:
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive configuration values
- Machine-specific encryption keys
- Automatic detection and encryption of sensitive data
- Secure key derivation using SHA256

### 5. HIGH: Buffer Overflow Risk in MP3 Decoder
**Location**: `internal/audio/decoder/mp3.go`

**Issue**: The MP3 decoder lacked proper bounds checking and buffer size validation, potentially leading to buffer overflows.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added input buffer validation
- Implemented maximum buffer size limits (1MB)
- Added comprehensive bounds checking in conversion loops
- Improved error messages with detailed information
- Added safety checks for array access

**Security Improvements**:
```go
const maxBufferSize = 1024 * 1024 // 1MB max
if len(buffer) > maxBufferSize/2 {
    return 0, fmt.Errorf("buffer size exceeds maximum allowed")
}
```

### 6. MEDIUM: Hardcoded URLs in Source Code
**Location**: `internal/network/streaming.go`

**Issue**: Radio station URLs were hardcoded in the source code, making them difficult to update and potentially exposing internal infrastructure.

**Fix Applied**:
- Created `stations.go` module for dynamic station management
- Implemented JSON-based configuration for radio stations
- Removed all hardcoded URLs from source code
- Added secure file permissions for station configuration
- Implemented station management API (add/remove/update)

**New Configuration System**:
- Stations stored in `radio_stations.json` with 0600 permissions
- Example stations provided for initial setup
- Dynamic loading and saving of station configurations
- Validation for duplicate stations

## Additional Security Enhancements

### Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of validation (frontend and backend)
- Parameterized queries throughout the application
- Comprehensive input sanitization
- Secure file permissions across all configuration files

### Logging and Monitoring
- Security events logged with structured logging
- Potential attack attempts logged for analysis
- Comprehensive error handling with secure error messages

### Secure Defaults
- Restrictive file permissions by default
- Encryption enabled for sensitive data
- Input validation enabled by default
- Safe DOM manipulation as standard practice

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Testing Checklist
1. **Path Traversal Testing**
   - Test with malicious file paths containing `../`
   - Verify files cannot be written outside designated directories
   - Test with encoded path traversal attempts

2. **SQL Injection Testing**
   - Test search functionality with SQL metacharacters
   - Verify parameterized queries are used consistently
   - Test with common SQL injection payloads

3. **XSS Testing**
   - Test all user input fields with XSS payloads
   - Verify HTML is properly escaped
   - Test with various encoding techniques

4. **File Permission Testing**
   - Verify configuration files have 0600 permissions
   - Check directory permissions are 0700
   - Test with different user contexts

5. **Buffer Overflow Testing**
   - Test MP3 decoder with malformed files
   - Verify buffer size limits are enforced
   - Test with extremely large input buffers

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards Met
- **OWASP Top 10**: Addressed relevant vulnerabilities
- **CWE Coverage**: Fixed CWE-22, CWE-89, CWE-79, CWE-732, CWE-120
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers implemented
